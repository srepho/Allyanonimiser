# Session Notes - July 23, 2025

## Session Summary

### Work Completed Today (v2.3.0 Release)

1. **Fixed Major Detection Issues**:
   - Fixed BSB and Account Number detection for labeled formats (e.g., "BSB : 062-000")
   - Fixed Organization detection for "Pty Ltd" companies
   - Added NAME_CONSULTANT pattern for consultant/agent names
   - Fixed PERSON boundary issues (no longer captures trailing words like "Subject")
   - Added comprehensive false positive filtering for PERSON and LOCATION entities

2. **Released Version 2.3.0**:
   - Updated all version files (pyproject.toml, setup.py, __init__.py, README.md)
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive release notes
   - Built and uploaded package to PyPI
   - Created GitHub release
   - Pushed all changes to GitHub

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added "Supported Entity Types" section to README
   - Documented all 38 entity types with examples
   - Created collapsible sections for better organization
   - Added Quick Entity Detection Test code example

## For Next Session

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Profile pattern loading impact (all patterns now load by default)
- Consider implementing lazy loading if initialization is slow
- Optimize overlapping entity resolution algorithm
- Add performance benchmarks

### 2. Enhanced Testing
- Add performance benchmarks for large documents
- Create tests for edge cases with complex overlapping entities
- Verify TFN and ABN checksum algorithms
- Add integration tests for all 38 entity types

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Update MkDocs documentation with v2.3.0 features
- Add section on handling overlapping entities
- Document validation functions and context analyzer
- Create troubleshooting guide for common false positives

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Add complete type hints to newer modules (validators.py, context_analyzer.py)
- Set up mypy checking in CI/CD
- Add debug logging for pattern matching
- Improve error messages for validation failures

### 5. Feature Considerations
- Make entity priorities configurable (currently hardcoded)
- Add pattern enable/disable options
- Implement batch processing optimizations
- Add export/import for detection results

### 6. Technical Debt
- Fix setuptools deprecation warnings about license format
- Clean up circular import prevention logic
- Implement cache TTL or size-based eviction
- Organize pattern loading more modularly

## Important Files Created/Modified Today

### New Files:
- `/allyanonimiser/validators.py` - Entity validation functions
- `/allyanonimiser/context_analyzer.py` - Context-aware detection
- `example_errors.md` - User-reported issues
- `FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of v2.3.0 fixes
- `comprehensive_entity_examples.md` - Complete entity examples
- `list_all_entities.py` - Script to list all entities
- `debug_pattern.py` - Pattern testing script
- `SESSION_NOTES_2025-07-23.md` - This file

### Modified Files:
- `/allyanonimiser/patterns/au_patterns.py` - Split BSB/Account, refined patterns
- `/allyanonimiser/patterns/insurance_patterns.py` - Added NAME_CONSULTANT
- `/allyanonimiser/patterns/general_patterns.py` - Enhanced ORGANIZATION
- `/allyanonimiser/enhanced_analyzer.py` - Added false positive filtering
- `/allyanonimiser/enhanced_anonymizer.py` - Added overlap resolution
- `/README.md` - Added comprehensive entity documentation
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Added v2.3.0 release notes

## Key Improvements in v2.3.0

1. **False Positive Reduction**: Added 100+ words to filter out common false positives
2. **Better Pattern Matching**: Enhanced patterns for labeled formats
3. **Boundary Detection**: Fixed issues with capturing extra words
4. **Entity Splitting**: Separated combined entities for better detection
5. **Documentation**: Complete coverage of all 38 supported entities

## User Feedback Addressed

1. ✅ BSB and Account Number detection in labeled formats
2. ✅ Organization detection for "Pty Ltd" companies  
3. ✅ NAME_CONSULTANT pattern implementation
4. ✅ PERSON boundary issues (capturing "Subject", etc.)
5. ✅ False positives for common words
6. ✅ README documentation completeness

## Notes for Development

- The package now loads all patterns by default (_load_default_patterns)
- Entity overlap resolution uses priority system in _remove_overlapping_entities
- False positive filtering happens in _filter_false_positives
- Context awareness implemented but could be expanded
- Test coverage good but property-based tests have some issues

## Version Status
- Current version: 2.3.0 (released to PyPI)
- Python support: 3.10+
- Key dependencies: spacy, presidio-analyzer, presidio-anonymizer
