## Current State — v3.1.1 shipped (2026-04-15)

- Published to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/allyanonimiser/3.1.1/
- GitHub release: https://github.com/srepho/Allyanonimiser/releases/tag/v3.1.1
- Tag: `v3.1.1`
- Tests: **207 passed, 7 skipped, 7 deselected** (`slow` + `performance` opt-in) in ~8s
- Ruff: 64 remaining (63 × E501 line-too-long, 1 × E402) — all non-autofixable

## What Shipped in v3.1.1

### Fixed (review items)
- `create_allyanonimiser` top-level wrapper forwards all kwargs (was silently dropping `enable_caching`, `max_cache_size`, `spacy_model`).
- `DataFrameProcessor.process_dataframe` raises `ValueError` for missing columns instead of silently warning.
- `tests/test_pyarrow_integration.py` rewritten against current API (old suite referenced removed `_to_arrow_table`).
- `load_spacy_model` logs a loud warning when falling back to `en_core_web_sm` or `spacy.blank("en")`.
- `DataFrameProcessor.process_dataframe` now wires `expand_acronyms=` through to `ally.analyze()` / `ally.anonymize()` (was swallowed by `**kwargs`).

### Changed
- Python support: `>=3.12,<3.14` (spaCy 3.8.x has no cp314 wheels). CI matrix `['3.12', '3.13']`.
- README / installation docs: "Python 3.12 or 3.13".

### Refactor
- `core/analyzer.py` split 1,230 → 850 lines. Extracted `analyze_common_formats` → `core/common_formats.py`; `deduplicate_and_resolve_conflicts` + `resolve_entity_conflicts` → `core/conflict_resolver.py`; `RecognizerResult` → `core/recognizer_result.py`. Validator dispatch collapsed into a Python 3.12+ `match/case`. Deleted ~75 lines of unreachable dead code.
- `reporting.py` → `reporting/` subpackage (`report.py`, `manager.py`, `__init__.py` with re-exports). No caller-side import changes.
- Ruff autofix sweep: 136 fixes (mostly `Optional[X]` → `X | None`, 8 × redundant open modes, 1 × deprecated import).

### Tests
- `pyproject.toml` `addopts = "-m 'not slow and not performance'"` excludes opt-in suites by default.
- 2 previously-skipped tests now green (`test_age_bracket_recent_dates`, pyarrow integration).
- `tests/test_example_scripts.py` rewritten to actually test the 2 examples that exist (was parametrized over 7 fictional scripts).

## Backlog

### Code-health
- **64 remaining ruff errors** (63 × E501 line-too-long, 1 × E402). All require manual reformat; cosmetic.
- `core/analyzer.py` is still 850 lines — `_analyze_with_spacy` and `_analyze_with_patterns` are the remaining large blocks if a further split is wanted.

### Test quality
- `tests/test_example_scripts.py`'s `main()` tests are marked `slow` because the CSV example does ~109s of I/O. Could be faster with a slimmer demo fixture.
- `_analyze_common_formats`, `_deduplicate_and_resolve_conflicts`, `resolve_entity_conflicts` are now module-level functions but have no direct unit tests — only covered indirectly through `Allyanonimiser.analyze()`.

### Features (previously deferred)
- Checksum validation for TFN/ABN is implemented in `EntityValidator` but commented out in tests; verify algorithms and re-enable.
- Configurable entity priority through a settings file (currently requires `EnhancedAnonymizer(entity_priority={...})` at construction time).

### Dev-env
- Local venv needs `python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg` for accurate NER; without it the fallback warning now fires loudly.

## Release process

Never `twine upload` without running the smoke script first. To cut a release:

```bash
# 1. Bump version in pyproject.toml, __init__.py, README.md, CHANGELOG.md.
# 2. Commit, then build + validate locally:
rm -rf dist build *.egg-info
python -m build
twine check dist/*
python scripts/smoke_release.py    # exercises sdist install + public API

# 3. Push, tag, push tag, hand artifacts to user for sign-off.
git push origin main
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 4. ONLY after explicit user OK:
twine upload dist/*
```

The Release Check workflow (`.github/workflows/release-check.yml`) runs
the same smoke script on every push, PR, and tag — so a broken release
fails CI before it gets uploaded anywhere. v3.1.1 would have been
caught by this gate.
